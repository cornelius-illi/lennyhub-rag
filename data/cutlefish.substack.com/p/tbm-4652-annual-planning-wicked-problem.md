Tis the season for annual planning.

I had a realization recently.

From a theoretical standpoint, a team can avoid the overhead and waste of annual planning. It isn’t difficult. How? To quote Jez Humble, “If it hurts, do it more frequently, and bring the pain forward.” You must plan, align, and calibrate more frequently. Teams that do this 1) limit planning inventory, 2) resist premature convergence, 3) research at the right time, 4) reduce sunk-cost bias, and 5) stay more strategically aligned.

That’s the theory. It is possible. But “reality” gets in the way.

**Annual planning is a classic wicked problem.** The harder it is, the less people want to do it! When outcomes suffer there’s an increased need/desire to “get it right”. The more people get caught in the cycle, the less available they are (and interested they are) for strategy outside the cycle. The busier people are, the deeper they get into the weeds. The more things diverge, the more effort required to converge. When people converge at the same time, there's more motivation to wait until that time. The more people feel pressured for a big plan, the more likely that plan will fail.

Here’s just a quick list of some of the variables at play. These are all answers to the question “why can’t we do more continuous planning?” Note when reading these how they play into each other.

So why can’t we do more continuous planning? Why is annual planning the best/worst option?

Note how these responses feed into each other.

**Too much time in execution mode.**

**Process is painful. Level of scrutiny is not desirable.**

**Annual budgeting cycle for new investments.**

> For big hiring asks -- like to spin up a new team to tackle a new challenge -- we’re pretty constrained to the annual budget. We have some leeway quarter to quarter but not much. The executive team presents the big asks to the board, and that tends to get bundled up with other big asks.

**Synchronizing with company events.**

> The big sales and marketing kickoffs are at the start of the year. They want to know what we are doing, so they can plan!"

**Planning for shared teams / specialist teams.**

>
>
> Our shared teams are overloaded. Everyone needs their help. They need to understand all the asks for the year, so that they can plan on whether to expand and hire.

This all begs the question…. How could we slowly chip away at the problems that “hold” a less-optimal ritual in place. What might we try?

As an interesting thought experiment, consider what taking two full weeks off from “business as usual” each quarter might offer a team. Impossible? Inefficient?

I’m not so sure.

I’d argue that 8 weeks spread across the year would EASILY out-perform a big final quarter push of planning annually.
