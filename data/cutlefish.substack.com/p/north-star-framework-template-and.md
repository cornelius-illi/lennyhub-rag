Hello!

I finally got around to organizing the templates and resources we use in our North Star Workshops at Amplitude. I apologize for how long this took.

[Here is the board.](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVPf0HwEA=/?share_link_id=112905984658) Check it out!

The Miro board contains:

1. 17 Miro templates/activities you can copy and use[1](https://cutlefish.substack.com/p/north-star-framework-template-and#footnote-1-68539815)

2. Loom videos explaining each activity

3. Links to free articles, long-form videos, and the original playbook

Feel free to share it far and wide.

The board is open for commenting if anything catches your eye.

Thanks!

To use the Miro templates, you’ll need a Miro account. They have a free version.
