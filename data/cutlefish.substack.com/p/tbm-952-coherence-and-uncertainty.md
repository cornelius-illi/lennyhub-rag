A simple idea for this week's post.

To make progress in product development we often need to:

* Introduce artificial constraints

* Agree to proceed with incomplete information

* "Cut corners" and do work we're not 100% proud of

* Suspend critique (and even disbelief/pushback)

The challenge I see is that teams are not intentional when they make these decisions. They don't understand each other.

For example, a product manager proposes an "MVP" for a new workflow. The team cuts all kinds of corners and leaves a lot of loose ends. And then the product manager up and decides to move on. "It is good enough I figure!" That wasn't what the team signed up for. They thought this was an experiment to test a set of assumptions, not an excuse to move fast.

Resentment grows. Trust drops.

An example of a healthier approach involved a team I worked on. We realized that to make progress, we needed to suspend almost all of our questions. But we detailed them, and revisited those questions/concerns weekly to figure out what to tackle next. As the effort progressed, the team decided that to move forward we NEEDED to answer a question, or at least come up with a better answer. So we put the brakes on to do that.

The key is being intentional.

* Catalog and visualize cut corners

* List enabling constraints

* Set reminders to revisit certain decisions

* Use clear language not jargon (e.g. MVP)

* Detail assumptions and experiment

* Keep a decision log

* Keep working agreements

* Get specific about [drivers, constraints, and floats](https://cutlefish.substack.com/p/tbm-1953-drivers-constraints-and)

That's it for this week. Again, something so simple, but often overlooked. Solving complex problems involves a lot of dancing with uncertainty. To do that as a team, you need shared language and some discipline. The alternative is pretending everything is fine, and just building to spec. And we know how that goes.
