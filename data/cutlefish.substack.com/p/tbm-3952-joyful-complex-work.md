[This thread](https://twitter.com/grimalkina/status/1561035008554348547) by [Dr. Cat Hicks](https://twitter.com/grimalkina) is one of the most thought provoking things I’ve read this year. I highly recommend you follow [Cat on Twitter](https://twitter.com/grimalkina).

Here is (most of) [the thread](https://twitter.com/grimalkina/status/1561035008554348547):

So much to think about! Don’t share this post with coworkers. [Share Cat’s thread](https://twitter.com/grimalkina/status/1561035008554348547).

I don’t have anything to add at the moment, but I do have a question for you! 

When we reframe the goal as “making it easier to work on complex problems” (vs. making complex problems easy) what comes to mind?

What describes an environment that is conducive to joyful work on complex problems?

What have you seen work?
