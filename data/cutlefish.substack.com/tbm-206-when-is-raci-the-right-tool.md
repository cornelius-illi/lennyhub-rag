RACI might be a good tool if you are experiencing one or more of the following dynamics ***and*** **you lack the time (or support) to address these issues in other ways**:

* People working in a workgroup, not a team

* People working together on a temporary/ad-hoc basis

* New or inexperienced team members (without norms or role models, see below)

* Acquisition, newly formed team, clash of work styles

* Frequent changes in team membership

* Forming a stable cross-functional team is difficult (some team members are not full-time, established specialist teams, etc.)

* Not worth investing in team resilience (temporary team, etc.)

* Large projects with lots of constraints and dependencies

* Risk of "negative externalities." Team 1's work can negatively impact Team 2

* Low trust or low psychological safety

* Communication difficulties

* "Superficial collaboration" or "token collaboration"

* In situations without an established set of norms or collaboration culture

* Lack of "role models" (individuals modeling effective collaboration)

* Informal conflict resolution is challenging (e.g., unsafe or unsuccessful)

* Incentives not aligned

* Unclear team mandates and areas of ownership

* Leaders are misaligned, putting pressure on groups/individuals to resolve misalignment.

When else have you found RACI effective?
