Hello!

I wanted to extend an invitation to all readers.

As many of you know, I work at Amplitude. Amplitude’s focus is product analytics and experimentation. It is one of the reasons why I get to interact with so many product teams, and share what I learn here.

I mostly keep Amplitude out of the newsletter, but I do make exceptions!

**We’re having [a conference](https://amplitude.com/amplify?utm_source=marketing&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=amplify-2022&refid=John_Cutler) in May (24th-26th). Virtual and in-person (Las Vegas).**

I’m speaking along with Crystal Widjaja, Justin Bauer, Elena Verna, Melissa Perri, Varun Parmar, Stephanie Halamek, and more. It is a great lineup.

Hybrid events are the new normal, I believe. Some people are delaying travel, which I fully understand and respect. Some people can and do want to travel.

If travel is your thing, **I wanted to give you a code for FREE registration to the in-person event in Vegas. The virtual event is free.**

PS: And yes, there’s a UTM in that link…because this time, I am going to win the employee contest 😊.

Thanks!
