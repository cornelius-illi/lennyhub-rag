Here’s a list of potentially helpful questions (and multiple-choice answers) to help you explore the ideas, strategies, opportunities, problems, bets, initiatives, and projects on your roadmap. Some notes:

* **Embrace uncertainty**. Saying “I don’t know” is a great outcome.

* **Embrace different perspectives**. If two people disagree, that is an excellent signal for a conversation.

* **Embrace learning.** As you progress as a product manager, you’ll learn how to 1) answer more of these questions, and more importantly 2) know what to do based on your answers.

* **Don’t use this as a gate**. Most product efforts attempt to answer these questions as a continuous, ongoing effort.

* **Don’t feel like you need to answer all the questions**. Jump around. There are correlations. You’ll notice patterns.

* **Don’t turn this into a form**. That would defeat the purpose.

* **Don’t take this too seriously**. It’s a fun product manager workout.

* **Don’t make anyone’s life difficult with this post (including your own life).** Thank you.

* **Want to make comments?** Try this [Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1eN9_jCv8oZPFrodFxcQjPpggIKxZFrenJE84KyaAbDU/edit?usp=sharing).

**Finally, if you found this helpful (no pressure at all)…**

----------

1. Very quickly. We can make visible progress in a very short period of time.

2. Moderately quickly. There are some challenges to overcome, but progress should be achievable within a reasonable timeframe
