# Welcome to LennyHub RAG 🎙️

I am your AI assistant for exploring the **Lenny's Podcast** knowledge base.

I can answer questions about:
- **Growth Strategies** (Adam Fishman)
- **Career Advice** (Ada Chen Rekhi)
- **Product Frameworks** (Curiosity Loops, PMF, etc.)

### Try asking:
- "What is a **curiosity loop**?"
- "How does Adam suggest hiring for **growth**?"
- "What is the **explore and exploit** framework?"
- "Compare Ada and Adam's advice on **career planning**."
